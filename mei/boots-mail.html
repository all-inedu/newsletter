                However, it can feel like there's so much out there, and you don't know where to start. Don’t fret!

                                For you, life might have been mundane—whle actually there are a lot of unsolved issues
                                around us. We might be able to do online schooling everyday without difficulties; how
                                about those kids who can't afford gadgets and internet subscription? Start coming up
                                with questions about your environment and you'll see some opportunities that may be
                                relevant for you to volunteer for.

                                Step 2: Connect a cause to something you like</b>

                                Let's say you want to do something about climate change, but you are rather introverted.
                                It might be too daunting for you to start volunteering by doing campaigns or starting
                                debate clubs, and therefore you won't do it sustainably. Instead, choose an activity
                                that you can enjoy—be it writing, drawing, teaching, and so on—and try to connect those
                                activities with issues (or questions) you care for.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li style="box-sizing: border-box;">
                            <b style=" font-weight: 700; font-size: 16px;color: #ffffff;">Step
                                Step 3: Set up teams, break down goals</b>
                            <p
                                style="box-sizing: border-box;margin-left: 1em;margin-top: 0;margin-bottom: 1rem;orphans: 3;font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;color: #ffffff;">
                                Now that you know the activity and issue to address, you probably still think it's very
                                complicated. You have one thing to build and one thing to break: your team and your
                                goal, respectively.

                Even when he was still in high school, Darren had set his eyes on political science and social issues.
                Aside from being actively involved in multiple extracurricular activities, including Model United

                His attitude of seizing every available opportunity shined during the university application period,
                where he aims for a scholarship in the US. All of his efforts paid off when he was awarded the Regents’
                and Chancellor’s Scholarship and Koshland May Scholarship for UC Berkeley. With these scholarships
                —and a lot of hard work on his part—Darren is able to study at UC Berkeley with full scholarship!
